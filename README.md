##Readme File

This readme file explains pieces of code that I have done in my MAGD 150 class that have been uploaded to this repository

For this lab I programmed three bubbles: One is controlled by the mouse, one has its height be based on mouseY, and the last one has its width be based on mouseX.

##f18magdlab04_McMahan

This oceanic lab consists of fish that move when a key is pressed, a wave that moves across the screen and changes height based on if the mouse is clicked, and an underwater volcano in the background.

Lab 5 is a television set that initialize seems intact that reveals itself to be broken when the ON button is pressed. The OFF button turns the television off an reverts it to a less broken appearance.

##f18_magd150_lab6_McMahan

This lab is a screensaver where various shapes move left, right, up, and down. To be honest the movement could have been diversified, but the program works nonetheless.

The final lab included in this repository is a coded photograph of nature. The mountains, clouds, sun, and pond are all comprised of PVectors that affect their position on the screen.
